# Emotion Recognition from Speech

This project aims to build a model that can recognize emotions in speech audio using deep learning and speech processing techniques. The model classifies spoken sentences into different emotions such as happiness, anger, and sadness.

## Features

- Emotion classification from speech audio
- Utilization of deep learning algorithms for accurate predictions
- Data preprocessing techniques for effective model training
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance
- Functionality to make predictions on new audio samples

## Algorithm Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**: A powerful ensemble learning method used for classification tasks. It works by constructing multiple decision trees and outputting the mode of their predictions.

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Disease Symptom and Patient Profile Dataset**. It includes various features related to diseases and symptoms, which are encoded and processed for model training.

## Getting Started

### Installing Libraries

Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can run the following command in your command line:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
