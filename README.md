# Emotion Recognition from Speech

This project aims to build a model that can recognize emotions in speech audio using deep learning and speech processing techniques. The model classifies spoken sentences into different emotions such as happiness, anger, and sadness.

## Features

- Emotion classification from speech audio.
- Utilization of deep learning algorithms for accurate predictions.
- Data preprocessing techniques for effective model training.
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- Functionality to make predictions on new audio samples.

## Algorithm Used

- **Random Forest Classifier**: A powerful ensemble learning method used for classification tasks. It works by constructing multiple decision trees and outputting the mode of their predictions.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **scikit-learn**

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Disease Symptom and Patient Profile Dataset**. It includes various features related to diseases and symptoms, which are encoded and processed for model training.
